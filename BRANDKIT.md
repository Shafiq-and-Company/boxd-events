The BOXD Gaming brand embodies a futuristic, competitive, and community-driven identity focused on clean geometry, deep contrast, and digital glow. The primary logo features a stylized lowercase “b” in a white circle, designed for clarity at small sizes with a minimum width of 24px and surrounded by clear space equal to the height of the “b.” It should be used on dark backgrounds, while the inverted black-on-white version is reserved for print or light-mode use. The color palette centers around a Primary Midnight Blue (#0A0F2C) background, with accents of Electric Blue (#2196F3) and Purple Glow (#6C63FF) for highlights and gradients, complemented by Neon Green (#1ED760) for status elements, and Light Gray (#E0E0E0) and Muted Gray (#9E9E9E) for text. Gradients such as linear-gradient(90deg, #2196F3 0%, #6C63FF 100%) are used for buttons, and subtle radial glows enhance depth. The typography uses Google Fonts—Orbitron for headings, hero text, and buttons in uppercase for a bold futuristic look, and Inter for body copy and labels for clean readability. Orbitron weights 600–700 are applied to titles, while Inter 400–600 is used for general text and buttons. UI elements follow a consistent visual rhythm: rounded buttons (radius 9999px) with gradient fills, card backgrounds in translucent white (rgba(255,255,255,0.05)), soft borders, and drop shadows (0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)). Layouts follow a 12-column grid with a 1200px max width, 24px gutters, and 2rem section padding. Interactivity emphasizes smooth transitions (200ms ease-out), subtle scaling effects (transform: scale(1.03)), and low-opacity glow animations on hover. Accessibility standards require at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio, ensuring clear visibility of all text and UI components. Overall, the BOXD Gaming design system merges cyber aesthetics with clean functionality, balancing high-energy visuals with clarity for a polished eSports experience.
