# BOXD Events

## Brand Kit

BOXD brand speaks with confident clarity and communal ambition. It favors clean, minimalist fonts and a palette grounded in neutral tones with bold accent colors—think charcoal or slate gray paired with vibrant teal or electric blue. The imagery is dynamic and aspirational: sharp event photos, silhouettes of crowds, architectural lines, and digital overlays to evoke motion, connection, and innovation. The voice is direct, inclusive, and purpose-driven: "Explore," "Connect," "Curated," "Frontier" — framing users as active participants in global conversations. Core values implicit in the visuals and structure are curiosity, access, and community—BOXD positions itself as the bridge between creators, thinkers, and doers.

### Design Principles
- **Layout**: Modular layouts and generous whitespace to reduce noise and let content shine
- **Typography**: Primary typeface with strong legibility (sans serif, medium weight) and complementary lighter version for captions
- **Colors**: One bold hue (teal/cyan) plus a secondary highlight (lime/chartreuse) for accents and interactive states
- **Iconography**: Linear and geometric (outlines, "connected nodes," minimal fills)
- **Messaging**: Emphasize discovery, belonging, and making impact—not just attending or watching

This brand kit orients any collateral (web, print, social) to look and feel consistent, modern, and collective.

## Next + Netlify Starter

Think of this like a LEGO kit for websites.
- **Next.js** is the box of LEGO bricks (the web app framework).
- **Netlify** is the shelf where your finished model goes so everyone can see it (hosting).

This starter gives you a tiny Next.js app that is ready to run on Netlify.
It includes:
- **2 sample components** in `components/`
- **Global styles** in `styles/globals.css`
- **`netlify.toml`** so Netlify knows how to build and serve
- **`jsconfig.json`** to make imports like `components/Button` work nicely

## Quick Start

1) Install packages
```bash
npm install
```

2) Start the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

3) Open the app
Visit `http://localhost:3000`

4) Edit something
Open `pages/index.js` and make a change. The browser updates automatically.

## Deploying (Putting it on the shelf)

- Easiest: click the "Deploy to Netlify" button above and follow the steps.
- Manual way:
  1. Push your code to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket).
  2. In Netlify, create a new site from your repo.
  3. Build command: `npm run build` (Netlify autodetects for Next.js).
  4. Netlify uses `netlify.toml` to handle Next.js features like server functions.


## Project Map

- `pages/` – Your routes and pages. Start at `pages/index.js`.
- `components/` – Reusable UI pieces like headers and footers.
- `styles/` – Global CSS lives here.
- `public/` – Images and static files.
- `netlify.toml` – Netlify’s settings for build and runtime.
- `jsconfig.json` – Lets you write clean import paths.
